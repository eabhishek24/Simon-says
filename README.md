# Simon Says Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple implementation of the popular Simon Says memory game. The game generates a random sequence of colored buttons that the player needs to repeat. The game becomes progressively harder as the player advances through levels.

## Features
- **Game Start**: The game starts once a key is pressed.
- **Random Sequence Generation**: The game generates a random sequence of colors for the player to repeat.
- **User Input**: The player clicks buttons to replicate the sequence.
- **Level Progression**: Each successful sequence increases the level, making the sequence longer.
- **Game Over**: If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and displays their score.
- **Flashing Effects**: Buttons flash in different colors to indicate the game sequence and user actions.

## Key Points
- **Game Sequence**: The game generates a random sequence of colors.
- **User Input Validation**: The userâ€™s input is compared against the gameâ€™s sequence.
- **Levels**: The difficulty increases as the player advances, with longer sequences at higher levels.
- **Visual Feedback**: Buttons flash to indicate the current sequence and the user's input.
- **Error Handling**: A game over occurs when the player fails to match the sequence.
